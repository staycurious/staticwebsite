                <h3>iii. How You Exercise Your Rights</h3>
                <p>To exercise your rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by hi@tutufungames.com</p>
                <p>Only you or your authorized agent may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for request for information twice within a 12-month period. A verifiable consumer request must: Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you identity and make us confirm we collected personal information about you. Describe your request with sufficient details that allows us to understand and respond to it.</p>
                <p>We cannot respond to your request accurately if we cannot verify your identity.</p>
                
                <h3>iv. How We Respond Your Request</h3>
                <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period by email, telephone or other electronic means.</p>
                <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
                
                <h3>v. Non-Discrimination</h3>
                <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Such discrimination include: denying you our services; charging you different prices or rates for our services; providing you a different level or quality of our services; suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services.</p>
                
                <h3>vi. Data collection instructions for minors</h3>
                <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.
