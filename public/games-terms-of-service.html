                <p>Types of Cyberattacks we take no responsibility:</p>
                <p>§ Malware: is a type of application that can perform a variety of malicious tasks – spy on the user in other to obtain credentials or other valuable data or to cause disruption.</p>
                <p>§ Phishing: is where the attacker tries to trick an unsuspecting victim into handing over valuable information, such as passwords, credit card details, intellectual property, and so on.</p>
                <p>§ MITM - Man-in-the-middle-attack is where an attacker intercepts the communications between two parties in an attempt to spy on the victims, steal personal information or credentials, or perhaps alter the conversation in some way.</p>
                <p>§ DDoS – Distributed Denial-of-Service attack – is where an attacker essentially floods a target server with traffic in an attempt to disrupt, and perhaps even bring down the target. A DDoS attack is able to leverage multiple compromised devices to bombard the target with traffic.</p>
                <p>§ SQL injection: is a type of attack which is specific to SQL databases. The attacker can exploit the HTML form to execute queries that will create, read, modify, or delete the data stored in the database.</p>
                <p>§ Zero-day exploit: is where cyber-criminals learn of a vulnerability that has been discovered in certain widely-used software applications and operation systems, and then target organizations who are using that software in order to exploit the vulnerability before a fix becomes available.</p>
                <p>§ DNS tunnelling: is a sophisticated attack vector that is designed to provide attackers with persistent access to a given target. Attacker are able to insert or tunnel malware into DNS queries. The malware is used to create a persistent communication channel that most firewalls are unable to detect.</p>
                <p>§ BEC – Business Email Compromise: is where the attacker targets specific individuals, usually an employee who has the ability to authorize financial transactions, in order to trick into transferring money into an account controlled by the attacker. BEC attacks usually involve planning and research in order to be effective.</p>
                <p>§ Cryptojacking: is where cyber criminals compromise a user's computer or device and use it to mine cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Organizations don't have great visibility when it comes to this type of attack, which means that a hacker could use valuable network resources to mine a cryptocurrency without the organization having any knowledge of it.</p>
                <p>§ Drive by Attack: A drive by download' attack is where an unsuspecting victim visits a website which in turn infects their device with malware. The website in question could be one that is directly controlled by the attacker, or one that has been compromised. In some cases, the malware is served in content such as banners and advertisements.</p>
                <p>§ Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: Cross-site scripting attacks are quite similar to SQL injection attacks, although instead of extracting data from a database, they are typically used to infect other users who visit the Website. It can happen on the comment section on a webpage.</p>
                <p>§ Password attack: is a type of cyberattack where an attacker tries to guess or cracks a user's password. Some examples: Brute-force attack, Dictionary attack, Rainbow table attack, Credential stuffing, Password spraying and keylogging attack.</p>
                <p>§ Eavesdropping attack: Sometimes referred as "snooping" or "sniffing", an eavesdropping attack is where the attacker looks for unsecured network communications to intercept and access data that is being sent across the network.</p>
                <p>§ AI-Powered attack: AI-powered software is able to slave machines to perform a huge DDoS attack. Also, can learn what kinds of approaches work best and Prince Island Games adapt their attack methods accordingly. They can use intelligence feeds to quickly identify software vulnerabilities, as well as scan systems themselves for potential vulnerabilities. AI-powered attacks can work around the clock, they are fast, efficient, affordable and adaptable.</p>
                <p>§ IOT-Based attacks: is a type of attack where an attacker goes through an IOT (internet-of-things) device and exploit target such as medical devices, security systems, smart thermometers in order to launch large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>
